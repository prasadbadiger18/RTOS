# RTOS Roadmap


Hereâ€™s a focused list of the most important RTOS topics every embedded software engineer should know:

1. Task Management
Creating and managing tasks.
Task states (ready, running, blocked, suspended).
Task priorities and preemption.

3. Scheduling
Preemptive vs. cooperative scheduling.
Priority-based scheduling.
Round-robin scheduling.

5. Inter-task Communication
Semaphores: Binary and counting semaphores.
Mutexes: Preventing priority inversion.
Queues: Data sharing between tasks.
Event flags: Signaling events between tasks.

7. Timers
Software timers for periodic task execution.
Delays using RTOS functions.

9. Interrupt Handling
Writing efficient ISRs (Interrupt Service Routines).
Task notifications triggered by interrupts.

11. Memory Management
Static vs. dynamic memory allocation in RTOS.
Monitoring stack and heap usage for tasks.

13. Debugging and Optimization
Debugging with JTAG or SWD (Single Wire Debug).
Using RTOS tracing tools (e.g., Tracealyzer, FreeRTOS+Trace).
Reducing task latency and optimizing scheduling.

15. Real-Time Concepts
Determinism and predictable task execution.
Understanding hard and soft real-time systems.

Key Applications for Embedded Systems
Multi-tasking: Running multiple tasks for sensor reading and data processing.
Interfacing with hardware peripherals (UART, SPI, I2C) within RTOS.
Real-time logging and data communication.
